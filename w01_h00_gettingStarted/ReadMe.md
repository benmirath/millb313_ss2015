Not much to say about this one, most were based on the examples very closely. With the last two, I tried to combine some of the inputs of mouse position and time to create some contrasting effects. I can mostly describe the interaction, but there's still a small bit that I could probably grasp better. I also tried translating the shaders to a few other platforms, but ran into troubles. I got it running on processing, but had errors with three.js and couldn't get to openFrameworks.
