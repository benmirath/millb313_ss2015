# Week 2 Homework - Movement Sketches


This weeks homework is a little bit of a letdown, as I misunderstood the initial assignment, and read through the entire next section, rather than just the shaping functions chapter. I ended up taking all my time trying the excorcises and wrapping my head around that that I didn't give myself enough time for the video capture project. I've tried a few here using procesiing to play the video, but have run into problems both mimicing the movement, as well as getting the video and shader to play together in sync.

# UPDATE

I'm leaving the above un-edited for documentation's sake. My first attempts to followup on and extend the previous homework I turned in were rough. I tried a whole bunch of shaping functions and different values, but the results were so abstracted that I couldn't related it back to what I wrote. I decided to take a little time to rethink my approach. I had an epiphany moment while out thinking about the basic level of control I had, and decided to approach both x and y at a simpler level, and layer on modifiers and shaping functions much more slowly. 
The approach I arrived at was starting with a sphere in the center, and then get the x motion close to what I wanted, as this was often simple linear or sine movement. From there, I started to add in functions to shape the y value and mimic the movements I had collected. Though I began this homework struggling to understand the math side of things, I think I'm getting more comfortable intuiting how to use them in a more intentional way.
