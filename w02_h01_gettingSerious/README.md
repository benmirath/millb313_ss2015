# Week 2 Homework - Movement Sketches


This weeks homework is a little bit of a letdown, as I misunderstood the initial assignment, and read through the entire next section, rather than just the shaping functions chapter. I ended up taking all my time trying the excorcises and wrapping my head around that that I didn't give myself enough time for the video capture project. I've tried a few here using procesiing to play the video, but have run into problems both mimicing the movement, as well as getting the video and shader to play together in sync.
